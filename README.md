# Stock Prediction Using Time-Series-Forecasting
\
Hello! Welcome to the WiDS2022 Project ***"Stock Market Prediction using Time Series Forecasting"***

## Project Introduction
Our journey of stock market analysis will begin all the way from learning the theoretical basics of python and machine learning to the hands on application of the knowledge to generate useful price predictions. Stock Price is a time stamped data which can be subject to autocorrelation, seasonality and stationarity. Time Series data can be modeled using techniques like moving average, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, etc. In the duration of the project, we shall better understand the jargon used above and then implement the ARIMA model to predict and test our model. 

Googling is the number one friend of any programmer. Although we shall have a WhatsApp Group for doubts and discussions yet I'll encourage you to have atleast 20 tabs worth of search before asking for help (PS - Everyone has a single lifetime so don't waste ages ofc!)

## Tentatie Schedule 

Week 1 - Setting up Jupyter Notebook and learn the basics of Python Language.

Week 2 - Learning the theoretical basis of Machine Learning in general and Time Series Data in particular.

Week 3 - Getting familiar with common AI/ML libraries and begin model implementation.

Week 4 - Complete the model implementation and learn about good coding practices

Week 5 - Debugging and Finalization of project along with discussions on further learnings.

## Week 1

[Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) - Anaconda is one of the most beloved tool for data scientist because it comes packed with a collection of over 7,500+ open-source python/R packages.

Data Science/Analytics can be performed with multiple languages like R/Matlab/Python. We shall stick to python in this project since it's a beginner friendly language and is widely used globally. Here are some good resources to learn python for data science purpose:

(PS - Understanding different data types like **lists**, **tuples**, **dictionaries** and **sets** helps in appreciating the benefits of libraries)

[W3School's Python Articles](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) - Best for students with prior programming experience.

[Python Tutorial by Mosh Hamadani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh) - More beginner friendly tutorial

*A basic understanding of datatypes, logical expressions, loops, lists and functions is enough to begin with*
